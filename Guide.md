# FACE RECOGNITION SECURITY MODEL

## Pages Required

1. **Landing Page** - this is the page that showcases the project, giving explanations and selling points for the system. From this page is where users can log in or sign up for an account. It also displays the contact information.
2. **Log-in and Sign-up Pages** - this is self explanatory.
3. **Home Page** - this is the page that users get redirected to after creating an account.
4. **Live Capture** - this page opens a camera window where live face recognition will occur. This is by far the most complex page to implement. It will allow users to also record or take photos then save them if they want.
5. **Upload** - this page allows users to upload either photos or videos for face annotation. Along with playing back the users the annotated video or showing them the annotated images, it also saves them in the database.
6. **Logs** - this page shows all the previous records from the system, along with allowing users to view them, the logs can be downloaded to produce reports. This will allow suspicious activities to have a documented report.
7. **Profile** - this page allows users to edit their information. This is because logs could also display if someone tempered with logs.
